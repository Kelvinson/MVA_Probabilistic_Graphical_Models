# MVA Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models
Guillaume Obozinski - Francis Bach

The course has 3 assignments, and the codes are written in python notebook.

* Assignment 1
    * Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    * Implement Logistic Regression using IRLS algorithm
    * Implement Linear Regression
    * Implement Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

* Assignment 2
    * Implement K-Means with random initialization
    * Implement Gaussian Mixture Model using EM algorithm

* Assignment 3
    * Implement HMM, including EM algorithm for parameter estimation, forward-backward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm for MAP inference.

Xiao CHU and I worked on the codes and reports for these assignments.
